<h1>Overview</h1></br>
[Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018) recently concluded its second annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey 2018. The survey posed 395 questions, some of which had sub-parts; the questions ranged from the usual demographic related queries to activities performed, Cloud computing tools, Big data tools, types of datasets, Machine learning frameworks and, other challenging questions.
As an aspiring data scientist, I was curious to find out the daily grind the average respondent undergoes at work or at school, and see how I compared with the 23859 respondents who participated from 147 countries and territories.
